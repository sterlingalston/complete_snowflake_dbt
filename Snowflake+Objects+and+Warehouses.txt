*** Snowflake Objects and Warehouses ***



- To grant a select privilege on a table, we also need to grant usage on the schema and database in which that table is located.

	Example: GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE DEMO TO ROLE ANALYST;
	GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA DEMO.DEMO_SCHEMA TO ROLE ANALYST;
	GRANT SELECT ON TABLE DEMO.DEMO_SCHEMA.BIKE TO ROLE ANALYST;
