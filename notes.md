### Commands

| command                     | description                          | example |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------- |
| dbt run                     | runs the entire model -- models only |         |
| dbt run select {model name} | runs a specific model; no sql needed |         |
| dbt build                   | models + tests + seeds + snapshots   |         |

### Development

- https://github.com/snowcertmalston4-boop/DBT_DEMO
- https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/install-dbt-extension
- power user for dbt

### Project File

{{}} -- jinja

{%%} -- logic/macros (functions)

` {{ ref('my_first_dbt_model') }}` -- references another model

`{{ config(materialized='table') }} -- placed in model sql file, materializes .sql as table/view`

dbt will always prioritize what is in the model itself, rather than global

```
select 
* 
from {{ source('demo', 'bike') }}

limit 10
```

a

```
select 
* 
from {{ ref('my_second_dbt_model') }}

limit 10
```

- the target folder in dbt shows the raw .sql that is generated by dbt after processing jinja templates
- "compiled/ shows rendered SQL, run/ shows executed SQL" because the
  compiled/ folder contains the SQL code generated after Jinja templates
  are processed, while the run/ folder contains the SQL that has been
  executed against the database, helping you understand both the
  transformation process and the results. This distinction is vital for
  debugging and validating your dbt models.

### Macros

- go in macro directory
- ![](assets\20250825_220434_image.png)
- calling the macro:

### Orchestration

- CREATE TASK (...) WAREHOUSE=(...) SCHEDULE='USING CRON 0 0 * * * UTC'
- CREATE TASK (...) WAREHOUSE = (...) [AFTER (TASK_NAME)] AS (...)
- If describing a task it needs to be resumed afterwards.

### YML Files

sources.yml can be named src.yml

![](assets\20250826_205354_image.png)

schema.yml - all configurations for specific models

schema and sources can be merged, but they MUST BE UNDER MODELS folder

packages.yml will be at same level as dbt_project.yml

### Tests

- singular data tests are for singular column in singular model
- generic data tests are macros written in test block

### Incremental

{{ config(materialized='incremental') }}

{% if is_incremental() %}

{% endif %}

![](assets\20250826_222022_image.png)

![](assets\20250826_223126_image.png)

#### full refresh

dbt run -m (model name) --full-refresh

#### debug

dbt run -m (model name) --debug

#### incremental

{{ config(materialized='incremental',incremental_strategy='append')}}

### ephemeral

- actual definition meaning anything whose duration is extremely limited

![](assets\20250828_081849_image.png)

- better to use views as opposed to ephemeral for larger sets
