*** CTES and working with dates - Part 2 ***

- If you're curious, here's some detailed documentation on Snowflake time and date functions:
	
	- https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/to_timestamp
	- https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/to_date
	- https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/hour-minute-second
	- https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/dayname
	- https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/year#usage-notes


The most important step with dates is first to try and convert your string into a timestamp (with TO_TIMESTAMP() or TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP() functions)
and then use that converted data as an input to the rest of the date functions
